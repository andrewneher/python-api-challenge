Andrew Neher's Bootcamp Homework Assignment

Observations from the Data:

1. Unsurprisingly, cities near the equator tend to have higher max tempuratures. Tempuratures in the Northern Hemisphere tend to be more varied than near the equator and in the southern hemisphere.

2. The northern hemisphere tends to have more humidity than the southern hemisphere, but not drastically so.

3. The further a location is from the equator, the more conditional weather varience that location has.
